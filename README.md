Ego-Splitting Framework From Non-overlapping to overlapping clusters

Our Framework works in the following steps:
1. Using Local clustering Algorithm.
2. We create Ego networks for each node in the original graph.
3. Construct the personas graph.
4. Using Global Clustering Algorithm.
5. we partition the personas graph then the result will be overlapping clusters in the original graph.
  
We are using 3 different datasets to test our framework.
